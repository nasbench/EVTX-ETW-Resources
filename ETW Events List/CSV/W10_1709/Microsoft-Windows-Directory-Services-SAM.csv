Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM|12288|System|SAM failed to write changes to the database. This is most likely due to a memory or disk-space shortage. The SAM database will be restored to an earlier state. Recent changes will be lost. Check the disk-space available and maximum pagefile size setting.
Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM|12289|System|SAM failed to restore the database to an earlier state. SAM has shutdown. You must reboot the machine to re-enable SAM.
Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM|12291|System|SAM failed to start the TCP/IP or SPX/IPX listening thread
Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM|12293|System|There are two or more objects that have the same SID attribute in the SAM database. The Distinguished Name of the account is {AccountDistinguishedName}. All duplicate accounts have been deleted. Check the event log for additional duplicates.
Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM|12294|System|The SAM database was unable to lockout the account of {UserName} due to a resource error, such as a hard disk write failure (the specific error code is in the error data) . Accounts are locked after a certain number of bad passwords are provided so please consider resetting the password of the account mentioned above.
Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM|12295|System|The SAM database attempted to delete the file {FilePath} as it contains account information that is no longer used.  The error is in the record data. Please have an administrator delete this file.

Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM|12297|System|{ComputerName} is now the primary domain controller for the domain.
Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM|12298|System|The account {ComputerName} cannot be converted to be a domain controller account as its object class attribute in the directory is not computer or is not derived from computer. If this is caused by an attempt to install a pre Windows 2000 domain controller in a Windows 2000 domain or later, then you should pre-create the account for the domain controller with the correct object class.
Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM|12299|System|The attempt to check whether group caching has been enabled in the Security Accounts Manager has failed, most likely due to lack of resources. This task has been rescheduled to run in one minute.

Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM|16642|System|The account-identifier allocator was unable to assign a new identifier. The identifier pool for this domain controller may have been depleted. If this problem persists, restart the domain controller and view the initialization status of the allocator in the event log.
Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM|16643|System|An initial account-identifier pool has not yet been allocated to this domain controller. A possible reason for this is that the domain controller has been unable to contact the master domain controller, possibly due to connectivity or network problems. Account creation will fail on this domain controller until the pool is obtained.
Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM|16644|System|The maximum domain account identifier value has been reached. No further account-identifier pools can be allocated to domain controllers in this domain.
Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM|16645|System|The maximum account identifier allocated to this domain controller has been assigned. The domain controller has failed to obtain a new identifier pool. A possible reason for this is that the domain controller has been unable to contact the master domain controller. Account creation on this controller will fail until a new pool has been allocated. There may be network or connectivity problems in the domain, or the master domain controller may be offline or missing from the domain. Verify that the master domain controller is running and connected to the domain.
Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM|16646|System|The computed account identifier is invalid because it is out of the range of the current account-identifier pool belonging to this domain controller. The computed RID value is {ComputedRIDValue}. Try invalidating the account identifier pool owned by this domain controller. This will make the domain controller acquire a fresh account identifier pool.
Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM|16647|System|The domain controller is starting a request for a new account-identifier pool.
Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM|16648|System|The request for a new account-identifier pool has completed successfully.
Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM|16649|System|The account-identifier-manager object creation completed. If the record data for this event has the value zero, the manager object was created. Otherwise, the record data will contain the NT error code indicating the failure. The failure to create the object may be due to low system resources, insufficient memory, or disk space.
Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM|16651|System|The request for a new account-identifier pool failed. The operation will be retried until the request succeeds. The error is  " {ErrorMessage} "
Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM|16652|System|The domain controller is booting to directory services restore mode.
Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM|16653|System|A pool size for account-identifiers (RIDs) that was configured by an Administrator is greater than the supported maximum. The maximum value of {Maximum} will be used when the domain controller is the RID master. See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=225963 for more information.
Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM|16654|System|A pool of account-identifiers (RIDs) has been invalidated. This may occur in the following expected cases:1. A domain controller is restored from backup. 2. A domain controller running on a virtual machine is restored from snapshot. 3. An administrator has manually invalidated the pool. See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=226247 for more information.
Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM|16655|System|The global maximum for account-identifiers (RIDs) has been increased to {NewValue}.  See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=233329 for more information including important operating system interoperability requirements.
Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM|16656|System|Action required! An account-identifier (RID) pool was allocated to this domain controller. The pool value indicates this domain has consumed a considerable portion of the total available account-identifiers. A protection mechanism will be activated when the domain reaches the following threshold of total available account-identifiers remaining: {CeilingTriggerRid}.  The protection mechanism prevents the allocation of account-identifier (RID) pools needed to allow existing DCs to create additional users, computers and groups, or promote new DCs into the domain. The mechanism will remain active until the Administrator manually re-enables account-identifier allocation on the RID master domain controller. See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=228610 for more information.
Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM|16657|System|Action required! This domain has consumed a considerable portion of the total available account-identifiers (RIDs). A protection mechanism has been activated because the total available account-identifiers remaining is approximately: {CeilingTriggerRid}. The protection mechanism prevents the allocation of account-identifier (RID) pools needed to allow existing DCs to create additional users, computers and groups, or promote new DCs into the domain.  The mechanism will remain active until the Administrator manually re-enables account-identifier (RID) allocation on the RID master domain controller. It is extremely important that certain diagnostics be performed prior to re-enabling account creation to ensure this domain is not consuming account-identifiers at an abnormally high rate. Any issues identified should be resolved prior to re-enabling account creation. Failure to diagnose and fix any underlying issue causing an abnormally high rate of account-identifier consumption can lead to account-identifier (RID) pool exhaustion in the domain after which account creation will be permanently disabled in this domain. See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=228610 for more information.
Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM|16658|System|This event is a periodic update on the remaining total quantity of available account-identifiers (RIDs). The number of remaining account-identifiers is approximately: {RemainingRids}. Account-identifiers are used as accounts are created, when they are exhausted no new accounts may be created in the domain. See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=228745 for more information.
