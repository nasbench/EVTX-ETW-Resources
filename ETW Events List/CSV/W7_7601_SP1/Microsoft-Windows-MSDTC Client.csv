Microsoft-Windows-MSDTC Client,,1073745922,0,,,,,Unable to translate the MS DTC error code to the appropriate MS DTC error message. The MS DTC error code was: {param1}.
Microsoft-Windows-MSDTC Client,,1073745923,0,,,,,You do not have permissions to manage the MS DTC on this system. MS DTC administrative functionality will be disabled.
Microsoft-Windows-MSDTC Client,,3221229573,0,,,,,The local MS DTC detected that the MS DTC on {param1} has the same unique identity as the local MS DTC. This means that the two MS DTC will not be able to communicate with each other. This problem typically occurs if one of the systems were cloned using unsupported cloning tools. MS DTC requires that the systems be cloned using supported cloning tools such as SYSPREP. Running 'msdtc -uninstall' and then 'msdtc -install' from the command prompt will fix the problem. Note: Running 'msdtc -uninstall' will result in the system losing all MS DTC configuration information.
