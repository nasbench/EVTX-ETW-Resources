Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service|34|System|The time service has detected that the system time needs to be  changed by {SystemTimeChangeSeconds} seconds. The time service will not change the system time by more than {MaxSystemTimeChangeSeconds} seconds. Verify that your time and time zone are correct, and that the time source {TimeSource} is working properly.
Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service|35|System|The time service is now synchronizing the system time with the time source {TimeSource}.
Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service|36|System|The time service has not synchronized the system time for {UnsynchronizedTimeSeconds} seconds because none of the time service providers provided a usable time stamp. The time service will not update the local system time until it is able to synchronize with a time source. If the local system is configured to act as a time server for clients, it will stop advertising as a time source to clients. The time service will continue to retry and sync time with its time sources. Check system event log for other W32time events for more details. Run 'w32tm /resync' to force an instant time synchronization.
