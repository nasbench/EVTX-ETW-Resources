Microsoft-Windows-Security-Kerberos|1073741828||The Kerberos client received a KRB_AP_ERR_MODIFIED error from the server {Server}. The target name used was {Targetname}. This indicates that the target server failed to decrypt the ticket provided by the client. This can occur when the target server principal name (SPN) is registered on an account other than the account the target service is using. Ensure that the target SPN is only registered on the account used by the server. This error can also happen if the target service account password is different than what is configured on the Kerberos Key Distribution Center for that target service. Ensure that the service on the server and the KDC are both configured to use the same password. If the server name is not fully qualified, and the target domain ({TargetRealm}) is different from the client domain ({ClientRealm}), check if there are identically named server accounts in these two domains, or use the fully-qualified name to identify the server.
Microsoft-Windows-Security-Kerberos|1073741829||The Kerberos client received a KRB_AP_ERR_TKT_NYV error from the server {Server}. This indicates that the ticket presented to that server is not yet valid (due to a discrepancy between ticket and server time. Contact your system administrator to make sure the client and server times are synchronized, and that the time for the Key Distribution Center Service (KDC) in realm {KDCRealm} is synchronized with the KDC in the client realm.
Microsoft-Windows-Security-Kerberos|65541||An error occurred while retrieving a digital certificate from the inserted smart card. {Error}
Microsoft-Windows-Security-Kerberos|2147483654||The Kerberos SSPI package generated an output token of size {NeededSize} bytes, which was too large to fit in the token buffer of size {ActualSize} bytes, provided by process id {ClientProcessID}.  The output SSPI token size is probably the result of the user {ClientName} being a member of a large number of groups.  It is recommended to minimize the number of groups a user belongs to. If the problem can not be corrected by reducing the group memberships of this user, contact your system administrator to increase the maximum token size, which is configured on each computer individually using the registry value: HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Kerberos\Parameters\MaxTokenSize.

The smart card PIN is stored in memory only for the current interactive logon session, and is deleted if the card is removed from the card reader or when the user logs off. To resolve this error, keep the card in the reader, open Credential Manager in Control Panel, and reenter the PIN for the credential {Username}.
Microsoft-Windows-Security-Kerberos|2147483662||The password stored in Credential Manager is invalid. This might be caused by the logged on user changing the password from this computer or a different computer.
