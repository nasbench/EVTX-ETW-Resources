Microsoft-Windows-PmemDisk|201|Microsoft-Windows-PmemDisk/Operational|Critical metadata on NVDIMM {PersistentMemoryDiskGuid} has been corrupted. Windows needs this metadata to start the NVDIMM correctly, so we had to reinitialize it. The data on that NVDIMM may have been lost.                                        Consider replacing the NVDIMM.                                        This NVDIMM may be located using the following information:                                        Slot number: {VendorId}                    Manufacturer: {ProductId}                    Model Number: {SerialNumber}                    Serial Number: {BinaryDataSize}
Microsoft-Windows-PmemDisk|202|Microsoft-Windows-PmemDisk/Operational|NVDIMM {PersistentMemoryDiskGuid} failed to start. {Status}                                        This NVDIMM may be located using the following information:                                        Slot number: {VendorId}                    Manufacturer: {ProductId}                    Model Number: {SerialNumber}                    Serial Number: {Reason}
Microsoft-Windows-PmemDisk|203|Microsoft-Windows-PmemDisk/Operational|NVDIMM {PersistentMemoryDiskGuid} started successfully.
Microsoft-Windows-PmemDisk|204|Microsoft-Windows-PmemDisk/Operational|One of the NVDIMMs that make up persistent memory disk {PersistentMemoryDiskGuid} encountered an error while transferring your data to or from persistent media (see the Details tab for more information). Some of your data may have been lost. As a precaution, this persistent memory disk is now in read-only mode. If you want to keep using it, run the Reset-PhysicalDisk command to make it writeable again.                                        Look at the events logged by the physical NVDIMM driver for more details.
Microsoft-Windows-PmemDisk|205|Microsoft-Windows-PmemDisk/Operational|During a previous boot session, one of the NVDIMMs that make up persistent memory disk {PersistentMemoryDiskGuid} encountered an error while transferring your data to or from persistent media. Some of your data may have been lost then. As a precaution, Windows made this persistent memory disk temporarily read-only. If you want to keep using this persistent memory disk, use the Reset-PhysicalDisk command to make it writeable again.                                        Look at the events logged by the physical NVDIMM driver for more details.
Microsoft-Windows-PmemDisk|206|Microsoft-Windows-PmemDisk/Operational|NVDIMM {PhysicalNvdimmGuid} notified the persistent memory disk driver of a change in its health state. The NVDIMM now has the following health status: {NvdimmHealthStatus}.                          This NVDIMM is part of interleave set {LogicalPersistentMemoryDiskGuid}.
Microsoft-Windows-PmemDisk|207|Microsoft-Windows-PmemDisk/Operational|One of the NVDIMMs that make up the persistent memory disk {PersistentMemoryDiskGuid} encountered a serious problem and the disk is now in read-only mode. Data that was saved to this disk may be lost when the computer shuts down or restarts. Consider backing up your data to another disk.                                        Use the Get-PhysicalDisk command to get more information about the disk's health status.
Microsoft-Windows-PmemDisk|208|Microsoft-Windows-PmemDisk/Operational|The driver could not confirm that the NVDIMM {PersistentMemoryDiskGuid} is healthy. To protect your data, the NVDIMM is now in read-only mode. Consider backing up your data to another disk.                                        This NVDIMM may need to be replaced. It can be located using the following information:                                        Manufacturer: {VendorId}                    Model Number: {ProductId}                    Serial Number: {SerialNumber}
Microsoft-Windows-PmemDisk|209|Microsoft-Windows-PmemDisk/Operational|The computer didn't assign any memory resources to NVDIMM {PersistentMemoryDiskGuid}. You won't be able to access the data on the device, but you can still query its health status by using the Get-PhysicalDisk command.                                        This NVDIMM may need to be replaced. It can be located using the following information:                                        Manufacturer: {VendorId}                    Model Number: {ProductId}                    Serial Number: {SerialNumber}
Microsoft-Windows-PmemDisk|210|Microsoft-Windows-PmemDisk/Operational|Some physical memory locations on NVDIMM {PersistentMemoryDiskGuid} are corrupt. In order to protect your computer, Windows will not access those locations and you may see failures trying to read or write to your data. Contact your hardware vendor to learn what recovery steps are available.                          This NVDIMM may need to be replaced. It can be located using the following information:                          Manufacturer: {VendorId}             Model Number: {ProductId}             Serial Number: {SerialNumber}
Microsoft-Windows-PmemDisk|211|Microsoft-Windows-PmemDisk/Operational|The problem with the persistent memory disk {PersistentMemoryDiskGuid} was resolved and it is now back in read-write mode.
Microsoft-Windows-PmemDisk|212|Microsoft-Windows-PmemDisk/Operational|One of the NVDIMMs that make up the persistent memory disk {PersistentMemoryDiskGuid} is in a degraded health state and may soon encounter serious problems. Consider backing up your data to another disk. Use the Get-PhysicalDisk command to see more information.
Microsoft-Windows-PmemDisk|213|Microsoft-Windows-PmemDisk/Operational|NVDIMM {PersistentMemoryDiskGuid} has encountered {MemoryEventCount} uncorrectable memory error(s). Uncorrectable memory errors can cause system instability and data loss. Consider replacing this NVDIMM.                          This NVDIMM can be located using the following information:                          Manufacturer: {VendorId}             Model Number: {ProductId}             Serial Number: {SerialNumber}
Microsoft-Windows-PmemDisk|300|System|NVDIMM {PersistentMemoryDiskGuid} is now in read-only mode.  Use the Get-PhysicalDisk command to get the device’s health status.  The Microsoft-Windows-PmemDisk/Operational event log may also contain more information.
Microsoft-Windows-PmemDisk|301|System|NVDIMM {PersistentMemoryDiskGuid} is no longer in read-only mode.
Microsoft-Windows-PmemDisk|302|System|Windows does not support this configuration: two or more NVDIMMs on this system are part of an interleaved set. Back up the data on the interleaved set to a different drive and then break up the interleaved set. Consider using Storage Spaces if NVDIMM capacity needs to be aggregated.
