Microsoft-Windows-DfsSvc|2147498189||DFS link {DFSLink} was marked incorrectly as a DFS root. The DFS namespace is operational on this server. If this namespace is hosted on servers running Windows Server 2003 prior to Service Pack 2 (SP2), or if the server is running Windows 2000 Server, the namespace might not be fully functional on those servers.  Please consult the Microsoft Knowledge Base for more information on correcting this issue.
