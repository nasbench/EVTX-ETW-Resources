This may be because the reverse lookup zone is busy or missing on the DNS server that your computer needs to update. In most cases, this is a minor problem because it does not affect normal (forward) name resolution.If reverse (address-to-name) resolution is required for your computer, you can manually retry DNS registration of the network adapter and its settings by typing 'ipconfig /registerdns' at the command prompt.
