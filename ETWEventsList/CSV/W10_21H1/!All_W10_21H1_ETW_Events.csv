Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM,Error,16657,0,System,,,,Action required! This domain has consumed a considerable portion of the total available account-identifiers (RIDs). A protection mechanism has been activated because the total available account-identifiers remaining is approximately: {CeilingTriggerRid}. The protection mechanism prevents the allocation of account-identifier (RID) pools needed to allow existing DCs to create additional users; computers and groups; or promote new DCs into the domain.  The mechanism will remain active until the Administrator manually re-enables account-identifier (RID) allocation on the RID master domain controller. It is extremely important that certain diagnostics be performed prior to re-enabling account creation to ensure this domain is not consuming account-identifiers at an abnormally high rate. Any issues identified should be resolved prior to re-enabling account creation. Failure to diagnose and fix any underlying issue causing an abnormally high rate of account-identifier consumption can lead to account-identifier (RID) pool exhaustion in the domain after which account creation will be permanently disabled in this domain.

If you see this event; an application has inadvertently or intentionally accessed this port which is reserved exclusively for LSA's use. The application (process) should be investigated to ensure that it is not attempting to tamper with this communications channel.

It is generated on the computer that was accessed.The subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested the logon. This is most commonly a service such as the Server service; or a local process such as Winlogon.exe or Services.exe.The logon type field indicates the kind of logon that occurred. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network).The New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created; i.e. the account that was logged on.The network fields indicate where a remote logon request originated.
