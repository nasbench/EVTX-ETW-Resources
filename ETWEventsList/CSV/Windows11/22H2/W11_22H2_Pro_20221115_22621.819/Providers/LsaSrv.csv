The New Logon fields indicate the account that was logged on. If all the user and device claims in the user token cannot be accommodated in a single event; multiple such events are generated. The Event in sequence field indicates how many more events are generated for this logon session. Each user or device claim is represented in the following format:	ClaimID ClaimTypeID : Value1; Value2 … The common claim types are: 0 (Invalid Type); 1 (64-bit Integer; 2 (Unsigned 64-bit Integer); 3 (String); 4 (FQBN); 5 (SID); 6 (Boolean) and 16 (Blob). If the claim value exceeds the max allowed length then the string is terminated by ...

LsaSrv,Error,5000,0,System,,,,The security package {Package} generated an exception. The exception information is the data.
LsaSrv,Error,6027,0,System,,,,Could not upgrade the global secret {Secret}. Please check the status of all services in the system.
LsaSrv,Error,6033,0,System,,,,An anonymous session connected from {Client} has attempted to open an LSA policy handle on this machine. The attempt was rejected with STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED to prevent leaking security sensitive information to the anonymous caller. The application that made this attempt needs to be fixed. Please contact the application vendor. As a temporary workaround; this security measure can be disabled by setting the \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\TurnOffAnonymousBlock DWORD value to 1. This message will be logged at most once a day.
LsaSrv,Warning,6035,0,System,,,,During a logon attempt; the user's security context accumulated too many security IDs. This is a very unusual situation. Remove the user from some global or local groups to reduce the number of security IDs to incorporate into the security context.User's SID is {SID}If this is the Administrator account; logging on in safe mode will enable Administrator to log on by automatically restricting group memberships.
LsaSrv,Warning,6036,0,System,,,,The program {Program}; with the assigned Process ID {PID}; supplied a NULL or empty target name for the pszTargetName parameter when calling the InitializeSecurityContext API to initiate an outbound NTLM security context. This is a security risk when mutual authentication is required.  To help protect against a malicious attack; make your code more secure. To do this; change the program so that it specifies a target name in the pszTargetName parameter field; and then recompile the code.
LsaSrv,Warning,6037,0,System,,,,The program {Program}; with the assigned process ID {PID}; could not authenticate locally by using the target name {TargetName}. The target name used is not valid. A target name should refer to one of the local computer names; for example; the DNS host name.  Try a different target name.
LsaSrv,Warning,6038,0,System,,,,Microsoft Windows Server has detected that NTLM authentication is presently being used between clients and this server. This event occurs once per boot of the server on the first time a client uses NTLM with this server. NTLM is a weaker authentication mechanism. Please check:       Which applications are using NTLM authentication?      Are there configuration issues preventing the use of stronger authentication such as Kerberos authentication?      If NTLM must be supported; is Extended Protection configured? Details on how to complete these checks can be found at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=225699.
